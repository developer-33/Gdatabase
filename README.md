# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

'The AK-47 stands for automatic Kalashnikov after its inventor, Mikhail Kalashnikov, and the year it was invented, 1947.Design
The AK-47 was designed to be a simple, reliable, and inexpensive fully automatic rifle that could be mass produced quickly. It's made of wood and metal, and is 10.5 in x 34.25 in x 3 in. The AK-47 uses a 7.62x39mm cartridge with a muzzle velocity of 2,350 ft/s. The cartridge weighs 0.6 oz, and the projectile weighs 122 gr. The high-velocity round can shatter bones, tear through organs, and liquefy other materials.
The AK-47 has a cyclic firing rate of 600 rounds per minute and can fire in both semiautomatic and automatic modes.The AK-47 has a distinctive muzzle brake that uses exhaust gases to pull the gun forward against recoil. Its also easy to clean, disassemble, and use, requiring no military expertise.',
